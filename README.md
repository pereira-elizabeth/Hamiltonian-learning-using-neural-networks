# ML Fidelity vs Noise â€” Skills Demo

This repository contains a small **machine learning demo** in condensed matter physics:  
predicting real onsite energies of a 1D chain and comparing **predicted vs true spectral densities**.  
The jupyter notebook includes the necessary functions to make the training and testing data of the neural network, the neural network, and also a code layout to study the robustness of neural netowrk, it is studied using the quantity called fidelity. The jupyter file has comments throughout the file for easy explanation.
