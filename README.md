# ML Fidelity vs Noise â€” Skills Demo

This repository contains a small **machine learning demo** in condensed matter physics:  
predicting real onsite energies of a 1D chain and comparing **predicted vs true spectral densities**.  
The jupyter notebook includes the necessary functions to make the training and testing data of the neural network, the neural network, and also a code layout to study the robustness of neural netowrk, it is studied using the quantity called fidelity. The jupyter file has comments throughout the file for easy explanation.

## âš¡ Demo Results

### Fidelity vs Noise
Shows how prediction fidelity drops as input noise increases when there is overfitting of training data.

Shows how prediction fidelity drops as input noise increases when we remove overfitting of training data by using a different neural network.

### LDOS Comparison
True vs predicted local density of states (LDOS) for one test sample without any noise.
